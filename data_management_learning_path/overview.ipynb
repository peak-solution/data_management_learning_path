    "In this collection of notebooks we will introduce and guide you through the major concepts of data management.\n",
    "The back end of our data management framework is based on the [ASAM ODS](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/ods/wiki/) - such that you'll learn data management skills using an established standard.\n",
    "Even though ASAM ODS has its origins in the automotive industry, it can also be used in other industries such as aviation, white goods or land machineries - to only name a few.\n",

    "* [📓 ASAM ODS Server and ASAM ODSBox](/ods/overview.ipynb)\n",
    "<br>In the *first chapter* we explain how to work with an ASAM ODS server in general. The content is mainly based on the open-source [Python ASAM ODSBox](https://peak-solution.github.io/odsbox/) - a thin wrapper over the ASAM ODS HTTP API. The intuitive JAQuel query language and the wide usage of pandas.DataFrames of **ASAM ODSBox** makes working with **ASAM ODS Server** more efficient and fun. \n",

    "### Importing your Data ###\n",
    "\n",
    "* [📓 ODS Data Plugins](/exd_api/overview.ipynb)\n",
    "<br>In the *second chapter* we address how to work with legacy data and ASAM ODS servers by using EXD-API Plugins / ODS Data Plugins.Besides the concept of **ODS Data Plugins** you'll learn that only a few lines of Python code changes are needed for creating an ODS Data Plugin for your (CSV) data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Data Management Workflows ###\n",
    "\n",
    "* [📓 openMDM](/openMDM/overview.ipynb)\n",
    "<br>In the *third chapter* we explain how to use Python to work with **openMDM** - an extendable open source framework on top of the ASAM ODS standard. The ASAM ODS openMDM companion data model in combination with the openMDM Web UI creates a kick-start for test data  management workflows. \n",

    "### Try it out ###\n",
    "\n",
    "* [📓 Using Notebooks](/notebooking/overview.md)\n",
    "<br>*Data Management Learning Path* is based on [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) such that you can interact and explore the content \"live\". You can find some hints and ideas how you can use **Notebooks** in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Big Data Connectors ###\n",
    "\n",
    "* [📓 Apache Spark](/spark/overview.ipynb)\n",
    "<br>In the *last chapter* we provide some basics how you can use [Apache Spark](📓 /spark/overview.ipynb) together with ASAM ODS and the **ASAM ODS Big Data** associated standard. As Apache Spark requires some additional setup, those notebooks cannot be executed online. \n"
