You use these catalog components to define the specific _Component templates_. You then combine these _Component templates_ to hierarchical _Component templates_-triplets, which can then be assigned to the individual _TestStep templates_. Finally, in the _Test templates_ you define which of the afore defined _TestStep templates_ can be used by an individual type of Test.\n",
