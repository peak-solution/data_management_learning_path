# Notebooking Overview

In this chapter, we give you some ideas what other you can do with our Notebooks.

## About Notebooks

[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are shareable JSON documents that combine descriptive information such as rich text, images or videos with live code.

The combination of documentation and data-analytical code makes Jupyter Notebooks the ideal choice for interactive data exploration â€“ especially with support for over 40 programming languages, including Python, R and Julia, combined with data access via Apache Spark or REST APIs and many more.

With Jupyter Notebooks, you can get a first overview of your data. By adding additional code and text cells, you can gradually gain further insights and document your results until you have achieved your analysis goals.

Furthermore, Jupyter Notebooks are a great environment for rapid software development - like we've shown you for the EXD-API Plugins.

Moreover, you can share your notebooks, either as JSON so that others can use them with their data, or as PDF or HTML so that you can create reports.
